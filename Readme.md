# How Popular Will Your Video Be on YouTube?

#General info

This is the final project for my Data Science BootCamp by WBS Coding School in 2022.

YouTube is the second-largest search engine in the world, just next to Google. YouTube has a list of trending videos that is updated constantly. Analyzing these trending videos can give content creators greater perspective and knowledge for increasing their popularity and brand of their channels. Besides helping professional YouTubers achieve their successful video marketing business, we also wish to support other non-professional YouTubers to improve their video more exposure rate and ultimately get the videos trended to match wide number of knowledge-searchers.
